# StockWebAppClone
This is a model for the finished project and may eventually be adapted into the final product.

This is a web app that is intended to be used as an inventory manager. As of right now the UI is in a very crude shape but I hope to make it much more lively very soon as well as to make it very intuitive and easy to use.

#	To start
##Requirements:
- You must have Visual Studio installed - version 15.6.1 or later.
- You must also have SQL Server and MSSQLLocalDB installed and configured to be used with Visual Studio for this app to work properly.
- Lastly you'll need a internet connection for the first time this app is used as it needs to (and will automatically) download some required packages.

##When ready:
Simply launch the project inside of visual studio then press F5 to begin.
