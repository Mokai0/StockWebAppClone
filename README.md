# StockWebAppClone
This is the finished project and may eventually be adapted into the finalized commercial product.

This is a web app that is intended to be used as an inventory manager, helping the user to keep track of his/her inventory in an organized manner.

#	To start
##Requirements:
- You must have Visual Studio installed - version 15.6.1 or later.
- You must also have SQL Server and MSSQLLocalDB installed and configured to be used with Visual Studio for this app to work properly.
- Lastly you'll need a internet connection for the first time this app is used as it needs to (and will automatically) download some required packages.

##When ready:
Simply launch the project inside of visual studio then press F5 to begin.

#Please Note:
-Due to the nature of this app and it's current state the responiveness is a bit hindered in that there is no 'hamburger' menu icon that will appear on smaller devices. Therefore to accomedate to smaller screens and prove responiveness concepts further when viewed on a smaller device or when the view itself is shrunk (by resizing the window it's viewed in on a computer) the Expiration Date column will become hidden.
-Also please keep in mind that as of right now duplicate items may be created into the database, this is a known issue and will be fixed in a later patch.
